In te file tensor_calculator.py I create a class calling TensorCalculator with the functions:
- tensor_zeros: input two dimensions and the function create a tensor of zeros with this dimensions
- tensor_ones: input two dimensions and the function create a tensor of ones with this dimensions
- tensor_rand: input two dimensions and the function create a tensor of random numbers with this dimensions
- tensor_sum: input four dimensions and the function create two tensor with this dimensions, one tensor with the two first dimensions and another tensor with the two last dimensions, and adds the two tensors
- tensor_mult: input four dimensions and the function create two tensor with this dimensions, one tensor with the two first dimensions and another tensor with the two last dimensions, and multiplies the two tensors
- tensor_div: input four dimensions and the function create two tensor with this dimensions, one tensor with the two first dimensions and another tensor with the two last dimensions, and divides the two tensors
- tensor_rest: input four dimensions and the function create two tensor with this dimensions, one tensor with the two first dimensions and another tensor with the two last dimensions, and subtracts the two tensors
